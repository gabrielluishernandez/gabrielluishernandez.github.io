## About
I am a Biologist specializing in molecular evolution, genomics, and population genetics. I graduated from Universidad Nacional de Colombia and have recently submitted my PhD thesis at Queen Mary University of London. My passions extend beyond the laboratory to chess, cycling, rock climbing, and music. My journey has taken me from cleaning rooms in a Miami hotel to pursuing a PhD in London, a journey I am immensely proud of. Looking ahead, I am motivated to tackle humanity's pressing challenges, including climate change, food security, health, and environmental conservation
